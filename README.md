# Android Template project

A boilerplate template to be used as reference or to kickstart a project quickly. It should be updated frequently.

## Usage

To be written...

## Jack and java 8

Currently Jack does not support databinding and realm. So retro lambda will be used instead until Jack does support these libraries.

## TODO

Initial setup to make for the following
* Dagger2
* Retrofit
* RxJava usage
* Realm
* Picasso usage
* Databinding usage
* RecyclerView examples
* Setup using mvp for testing purposes
* Productflavors/builds ( Stage, test?, mock )

Testing everything
* Unit testing
* UI tests

## Not included by default

* Any analytics
* Firebase
